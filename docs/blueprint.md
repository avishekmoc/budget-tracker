## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#6663CD) for a sense of sophistication and control. Chosen for the sense of stability, but without using overdone cliches.
- Background color: Light Lavender (#E6E6FA), a very desaturated, bright shade of the same indigo hue.
- Accent color: Violet (#8A2BE2), which is more saturated and slightly less bright than the primary to ensure visibility while also harmonizing within the overall color scheme.
- Clean, sans-serif font for calculator interfaces to ensure numbers and labels are easily readable.
- Use minimalist, custom icons for each calculator type and spending category for clarity.
- Responsive grid layout adapting to various screen sizes; prioritizing mobile usability.
